# Description

Symmetric and non symmetric layouts for machine learning algorithms.

Images are 200x200 pixels.
Vertices are encoded as circles with 3x3 pixels
Edges width is 1px.

The graphs layouts have vertices in the range [30, 40] and edges in the range [|V|, |V|*1.2].

The name convention is the following:

{id}-{symmetric/nonsymmetric}-{typeofgraph}-0-{rotation_angle}.png
